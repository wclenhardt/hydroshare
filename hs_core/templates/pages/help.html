                                    TCC is partnering with hospitals, community hospices, AARP and an SECU-supported estate planning law firm to offer a persistent and discoverable online tool for individuals’ advance directives and medical information. The online tool will facilitate the adoption of advance care planning among younger and more diverse populations and will provide the ability for individuals to link their advance care plans and health information to the people named as healthcare agent(s) and others they want to alert to their healthcare wishes. The linkages can be to family, friends, clinicians or other representatives, all chosen by the individual.

                                    In MyHPOM, we define a resource as digital content which includes the science data files or model files and their corresponding metadata information. MyHPOM supports multiple resource types including Generic, Geographic Raster, Model Progam, Model Instance, SWAT Model Instance, Multidimensional (NetCDF), Time Series, Web App, and Geographic Feature (ESRI Shapefiles).
